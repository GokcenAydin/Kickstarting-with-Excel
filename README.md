# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

This report was created to graphically represent the outcomes of theater and play campaings on the Kickstarter Excel sheet based on their success, fail and cancel rates and according to their launch dates and financial goals. 
Using the data on the Kickstarter, theaters and plays were evaluated in two seperate categories. 
Theaters were reviewed by the month they were launched, and plays were evaluated by their success rate in reaching their financial goals. Both results were represented with related tables and charts. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this report is revealing the outcomes of theater and play campaigns by success/fail/cancel rates based on the month they were launched and in terms of seizing their financial targets.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In the Outcomes Based on Launch Date datasheet, the number of successful, failed and canceled campaigns were reflected on a Pivot table and Line chart and interpreted in accordingly with their launching months, 
revealing the findings below:
The count of successful outcomes shows a significant increase between April to August, with the highest levels of the year in May and June, and the lowest in December. 
While May and June might be considered as the high season terms of the year, December might be considered as the lowest according to the outcomes.
Failed count of outcomes show a balanced distribution throughout the year, except for slightly lower values in September and November.
The count of cancel outcomes reflect the highest value in January, and the lowest in July, and do not reflect radical fluctuations during the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In the Outcomes Based on Goals datasheet, twelve different dollar-amount ranges were created in the goal column in order to group the projects based on their target amounts.
The numbers of successful, failed and canceled campaigns were distributed in this datasheet in accordingly with these ranges, and percentage columns reflected the ratios of each group to the number of total projects, 
revealing the findings below:
The majority of total projects, which was 534 campaigns, aimed to pledge between "1000 to 4999" range, followed by 186 in "less than 1000" range and 169 between "5000 to 9999" range, which were the lowest amount ranges in the list.
Moreover, with the ratio of 76%, the campaigns which targeted less than 1000 pledge amount reflected the highest percentage of success; followed by 73% success rate of the range 1000 to 4999. 
A majority of the campaigns showed a success ratio of above 50% in a general look; however, 14 campaigns out of 16 aimed at the range of 50000 or more, showed 88% failure, which is the second highest fail ratio after the 100% failure 
between 45000 to 49000 range.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Application of different formulas for differet kinds of data in such a big datasheet took a great amount of time because of inexperience. I encountered several errors in trying formulas, as fully comprehending what was expected, and rendering a decision on how to reach that information by using that big data, was challenging in most ways.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The term from April to August might be a good period to launch theater projects as the success rate is high; especially in May, June and July with the highest success rates.
November and December might be considered as unadvantageous terms to launch a project as success and fail numbers are pretty close. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The majority of the projects targeted pledge amounts of $9.999 and below; and these campaigns reflected the highest rates of success when compared to the others.
The campaigns with over $45.000 financial goal, reflected a high rate of failure in seizing their targets.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
In Outcomes Based on Goals datasheet, total number of campaigns which targeted over $35.000 pledge amount is pretty few in numbers, which eventually affects the success and fail percentage of the general with high ratios; like 100% fail
ratio of one single campaign within "45000 to 49000 range", affecting the whole line chart. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a Pie Chart, reflecting the success, fail and canceled percentages in the Outcomes Based on Goal datasheet. 
We could use a clustered or stacked column in Theater Outcomes by Laund Date.
